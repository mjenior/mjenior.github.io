In order to even say if my method of subsampling transcripts is even better than not doing it at all, 
I need to make the actual comparison.  The metric I'm using is simply how many reads map to the C. difficile 
genome.  It's not only the only specific organism I care about right now, but it's also at very low 
abundance in each community so it should be pretty telling if it isn't detectable after subsampling.
