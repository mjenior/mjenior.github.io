I was recently selected to present at the annual UVA postdoc research symposium! It felt fantastic to give a talk in person again. I was so happy to finally present some of my work using computational systems biology approaches to assembling and testing bacterial consortia as a targeted FMT against *C. difficile* infection. I also got really great feedback from all of the wonderful scientists in attendance.

Thank you again to all of the organizing committee for putting the event together, they really did an incredible job.
