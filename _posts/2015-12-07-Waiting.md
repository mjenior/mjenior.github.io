So as I'm waiting for assemblies to finish I got impatient waiting for jobs to finish, so I wrote this bash script:


	#!/bin/bash

	# This script lets you watch my jobs on axiom run in real time. Total time waster.

	while :
	do
	clear
	qstat -u $1
	echo "Press [CTRL+C] to stop..."
	sleep 1
	done
	
	
All you need to enter the bash script and your axiom username.


	bash /home/mljenior/scripts/bored.bash mljenior
	
	
The screen is cleared and output is printed every second so you can watch your jobs in real time.  Hopefully my jobs finish soon...
