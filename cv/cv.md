###Research & Experience

####Ph.D. Candidate with Dr. Patrick Schloss, University of Michigan, April 2012 – present
My thesis research investigates the role of nutrient niche exclusion by the gut microbiome in 
colonization resistance to Clostridium difficile infection.  To address these questions, I rely on:

- Mouse models of bacterial infection
- Anaerobic bacterial cultivation
- Preparation for 16S rRNA amplicon, metagenomic, and metatranscriptomic sequencing libraries
- Operation and maintenance of Illumina high-throughput sequencers
- Bioinformatic tools for assessing 16S relative abundance data, metagenomic assembly + annotation, transcript mapping, and machine learning
- Genome-scale metabolic modeling of bacteria
- Strong knowledge of both Python and R programming languages
- Experience in several parametric and nonparametric statistical methods

####Research Internship, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, June 2010 – August 2010
- Immunological Research Department – Used machine learning algorithms to predict Crohn’s disease patient response to drug therapy combining both microbiome and host epithelial microarray data.

####Research Internship, Kent State University, June 2010 – August 2010
- Laboratory of Dr. Helen Piontkivska – Constructed a SQL database with a Python generated interface for uncovering co-occurrence and immunodominance of HIV-1 epitopes across subtypes of the virus.

####Research Assistantship, Hiram College, February 2009 – December 2010
- Laboratory of Dr. Bradley Goodner – Worked to elucidate functional differences between five putative copies of glutamine synthetase in Agrobacterium tumefaciens through forward genetic screens.
