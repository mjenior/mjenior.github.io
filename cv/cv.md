Summary
---------------------

I am a highly motivated bench-turned-informatics scientist with an extremely strong background in not only the biology of microbial ecosystems, but the computational means to study them at a fine resolution.  I have independently moved large projects from the genesis of original ideas, all the way to presentation and publication of finished work during my PhD. thesis.  Accomplishing these goals involved developing novel workflows to harness large metagenomic and metatranscriptomic datasets for understanding complex community-level interactions that drive human health and disease. Additionally, having experience with research both in academic and industry settings, I am uniquely suited to collaborate with a variety of personnel to complete projects on time using innovative approaches.

Research & Experience
---------------------

**Ph.D. Candidate with Dr. Patrick Schloss, University of Michigan, April 2012 – present**

- My thesis research investigates the role of nutrient niche exclusion by the gut microbiome in colonization resistance to Clostridium difficile infection.  I accomplished this through the use of metagenomic-enabled metatranscriptomics to identify how community-level metabolism shifted in response to antibiotic treatment and pathogen colonization.

**Research Internship, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, June 2011 – August 2011**

- Immunological Research Department – Used machine learning algorithms to predict Crohn’s disease patient response to drug therapy combining both microbiome and host epithelial microarray data.

**Research Internship, Kent State University, June 2010 – August 2010**

- Laboratory of Dr. Helen Piontkivska – Constructed a relational database of HIV-1 epitope co-occurrence and immunodominance across subtypes of the virus to uncover frequently occurring patterns for potential vaccine design.

**Research Assistantship, Hiram College, February 2009 – December 2010**

- Laboratory of Dr. Bradley Goodner – Worked to elucidate functional differences between five putative copies of glutamine synthetase in Agrobacterium tumefaciens using forward genetic screens.
