Training
---------------------

- Postdoctoral Training - Biomedical Engineering, University of Virginia, August 2017 - present
- Ph.D. - Microbiology & Immunology, University of Michigan, July 2011 - July 2017
- B.A. - Biology, Hiram College - graduated Cum Laude, August 2007 - May 2011


Research & Experience
---------------------

**Postdoctoral Research Associate with Dr. Jason Papin, University of Virginia, August 2017 - present**

- My postdoctoral research centers on implementing metabolic network reconstruction techniques, with integration of high-throughput metatranscriptomic and metabolomic data in order to engineer probiotic bacterial consortia against Clostridioides difficile infection.

**Ph.D. Candidate with Dr. Patrick Schloss, University of Michigan, April 2012 – July 2017**

- My dissertation research investigated the role of nutrient niche exclusion by the gut microbiome in colonization resistance to *Clostridium difficile* infection.  I accomplished this through the use of metagenomic-enabled metatranscriptomics to identify how community-level metabolism shifted in response to antibiotic treatment and pathogen colonization.

**Research Internship, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, June 2011 – August 2011**

- Immunological Research Department – Used machine learning algorithms to predict Crohn’s disease patient response to drug therapy combining both microbiome and host epithelial microarray data.

**Research Internship, Kent State University, June 2010 – August 2010**

- Laboratory of Dr. Helen Piontkivska – Constructed a relational database of HIV-1 epitope co-occurrence and immunodominance across subtypes of the virus to uncover frequently occurring patterns for potential vaccine design.

**Research Assistantship, Hiram College, February 2009 – December 2010**

- Laboratory of Dr. Bradley Goodner – Worked to elucidate functional differences between five putative copies of glutamine synthetase in *Agrobacterium tumefaciens* using forward genetic screens.
