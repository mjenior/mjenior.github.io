While cd-hit is approaching hour 45 I'm going to use something much faster to de-replicate the sequences, fastx_collapser. In the time it's taken to cluster these sequences we've landed on a comet.

Like all software written by scientists (and frankly, like all scientists) fastx_collapser is picky and unforgiving. Input must be formatted a certain way and weird whitespace will cause it to throw a hissy fit, but if you can get over these initial roadblocks you'll come to love this little tool (see: scientists).
