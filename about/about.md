Broadly speaking, I'm interested in how communities of bacteria handle their metabolism in the face of large changes like 
antibiotic treatment or invasion by a pathogen. To look at this, I leverage several methods involving high-throughput sequencing, metabolomics, and metabolic reconstruction to infer the nutrient utilization and metabolic cross-talk between species which ultimately impact the health of the host. Through this approach, we may be able to uncover ways to make bacterial communities more inhospitable to unwanted guests and ultimately prevent disease.

I am currently a postdoctoral research associate in the lab of Dr. Jason Papin at the University of Michigan. My 
research involves making sense of large community-level datasets from the gut microbiome. Hence the title of my blog!

This blog is a chronicle of my experiences in science, hopefully enjoy it or even find it helpful in any project you might be working on!
