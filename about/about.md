I am currently a graduate student, working on my PhD. in the lab of Dr. Pat Schloss at the University of Michigan.  My 
thesis project involves making sense of large community-level datasets from the gut microbiome.  Hence the title of my blog!

Broadly speaking, I'm interested in how communities of bacteria handle their metabolism in the face of large changes like 
antibiotic treatment or invasion by a pathogen.  To look at this, I leverage several methods for metagenomics, metranscriptomics, 
and metabolic modeling to infer the nutritional requirements and metabolic cross-talk between species.  Through this approach, 
we may be able to uncover ways to make bacterial communities more inhospitable to unwanted guests and ultimately prevent disease.

This blog is meant to be a chronicle of my thesis research.  As customary for a thesis, expect some mix of progress with procrastination :)
