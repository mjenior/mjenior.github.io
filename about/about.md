Broadly speaking, I'm interested in how host-associated communities of bacteria handle their metabolism in the face of large changes like antibiotic treatment or invasion by a pathogen. To look at this, I leverage several methods involving high-throughput sequencing, metabolomics, and metabolic reconstruction to infer the nutrient utilization and metabolic cross-talk between species which ultimately impact the health of the host. Through this approach, we may be able to uncover ways to make bacterial communities more inhospitable to unwanted guests and ultimately prevent disease.
